Howdy! I am a senior computer engineering student at Texas A&M University, advised by Dr. [Xia (Ben) Hu](https://cs.rice.edu/~xh37/). In Fall 2021, I interned at Nvidia on the Drive IX team working on synthetic data generation and vehicle user authentication pipeline. I also interned at Arm in Summer 2021 working on a front end web app. My interest lies in computer vision, autonomous driving and robotics.

My hobbies include running, working out, playing the guitar, and photography.
